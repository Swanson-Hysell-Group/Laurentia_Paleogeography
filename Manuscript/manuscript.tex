\subsection{Abstract}

Laurentia was a major continent throughout the majority of the Proterozoic. It is hypothesized to have had a central position in both the Paleoproterozoic Nuna and Neoproterozoic Rodinia supercontinents. The paleogeographic position of Laurentia is key to the development of reconstructions of Proterozoic paleogeography. There is a rich record of Precambrian paleomagnetic poles from Laurentia, as well as an extensive and well-documented geologic history of tectonism. These geologic and paleomagnetic records are increasingly better constrained geochronologically and are both key to evaluating and developing paleogeographic models. Data from the Slave and Superior provinces of Laurentia provide what is arguably the strongest evidence of differential plate tectonics in the Rhyacian and Orosirian Periods of the Paleoproterozoic Era (2.3 to 1.8 Ga) leading up to the collision of these terranes during the Trans-Hudson orogeny. The collisions of these and other Archean provinces led to the formation of the core of Laurentia. Subsequent crustal growth occurred through multiple intervals of accretionary orogenesis through the late Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic until the continent-continent collision of the Grenvillian orogeny that was ongoing at the Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic boundary (1.0 Ga). The lead-up to this orogeny was associated with rapid plate motion of Laurentia from high latitudes towards the equator recorded by the Logan Loop and Keweenawan Track of paleomagnetic poles. Following, a return to high-latitudes as constrained by paleomagnetic poles of the Grenville Loop, Laurentia straddled the equator at the time of Cryogenian Snowball Earth glaciation as part of the Rodinia supercontinent. Rifting and passive margin development then isolated Laurentia in the early Paleozoic Era. Subsequent accretionary and collisional orogenesis occurred associated with the Appalachian orogenic cycle with Laurentia first colliding with Avalonia–Baltica to become Laurussia and Laurussia then uniting with Gondwana to form Pangea. While the details of the conjugate continents are better reconstructed for this last Wilson cycle, the broad features of the Trans-Hudson, Grenvillian and Appalachian orogenic cycles bear similarities. In each case, accretionary collision of arc terranes was followed by continent-continent collision. The major difference is that the collisions of the Grenvillian and Appalachian orogenic cycles resulted in relatively minor crustal growth compared to the Trans-Hudson. Break-up following the Grenvillian and Appalachian orogenic cycles occurred along the same margin as collision while the major orogens of the Trans-Hudson orogenic cycle have remained sutured. As a result, Laurentia has been a formidable continent for the past 1.8 billion years whose position and history is key for reconstructing global paleogeography. The evidence from Laurentia provides strong-support for mobile lid plate tectonic processes operating over the past 2.2 billion years.

\subsection{Introduction and broad tectonic history}

Laurentia refers to the craton that forms the Precambrian core of North America (Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_map}). Laurentia is comprised of multiple Archean provinces that had unique histories prior to their amalgamation in the Paleoproterozoic, as well as tectonic zones of crustal growth that post-date this assembly \citep{Hoffman1989a, Whitmeyer2007a}. Collision between the Superior province and the composite Slave+Rae+Hearne provinces that resulted in the Trans-Hudson orogeny represents a major event in the formation of Laurentia \citep{Corrigan2009a}. Terminal collision recorded in the Trans-Hudson orogen is estimated to have been ca. 1.86 to 1.82 Ga based on constraints such as U-Pb dating of monazite grains and zircon rims \citep[e.g.]{Skipton2016a, Weller2017a}. A period of accretionary and collision orogenesis is recorded in the constituent provinces and terranes of Laurentia leading up to the terminal collision of the Trans-Hudson orogeny. This overall story of rapid Paleoproterozoic amalgamation of Laurentia's constituent Archean provinces, including the terminal Trans-Hudson orogeny, was synthesized in the seminal \textit{United Plates of America} paper of \citet{Hoffman1988a} and has been refined in the time since -- particularly with additional geochronological constraints. Of most relevance here are the events that led to the suturing of more major Archean provinces: the Thelon orogen associated with the collision between the Slave and Rae provinces ca. 2.0 to 1.9 Ga \citep{Hoffman1989a}; the Snowbird orogen associated with ca. 1.89 Ga collision between the Rae and Hearne provinces and associated terranes \citep{Berman2007a}; the Nagssugtoqidian orogen due to the ca. 1.86 to 1.84 Ga collision between the Rae and North Atlantic provinces \citep{St-Onge2009a}; and the Torngat orogen resulting from the ca. 1.87 to 1.85 Ga collision of the Meta Incognita province (grouped with the Rae province in older compilations) with the North Atlantic province \citep{St-Onge2009a}. As for the Wyoming province, many models posit that it was conjoined with Hearne and associated provinces at the time of the Trans-Hudson orogeny \citep[e.g.][]{St-Onge2009a, Pehrsson2015a} or was proximal to Hearne and Superior while still undergoing continued translation up to ca. 1.80 Ga \citep{Whitmeyer2007a}. A contrasting view has been been proposed that the Wyoming province and Medicine Hat blocks was not conjoined with the other Laurentia provinces until ca. 1.72 Ga \citep{Kilian2016b}. This interpretation is argued to be consistent with geochronological constraints on monazite and metamorphic zircon indicating active collisional orogenesis associated with the Big Sky orogen on the northern margin of the craton as late as ca. 1.75 to 1.72 Ga \citep{Condit2015a} and ca. 1.72 tectonomagmatic activity in the Black Hills region \citep{Redden1990a}. However, the evidence for earlier orogenesis ca. 1.78 to 1.75 in the Black Hills \citep{Dahl1999a,Hrncir2017a}, as well as high-grade tectonism as early as ca. 1.81 Ga in the Big Sky orogen \citep{Condit2015a}, may support the interpretation of \citet{Hrncir2017a} that ca. 1.72 Ga activity is a minor overprint on ca. 1.75 terminal suturing between Wyoming and Superior. Regardless, in both of these interpretations, Wyoming is a later addition to Laurentia with final suturing post-dating ca. 1.82 Ga amalgamation of Archean provinces with the Trans-Hudson orogen further to the northeast. Overall, the collision of these Archean microcontinents between ca. 1.9 and 1.8 Ga lead to rapid amalgamation of the majority of the Laurentia craton.

Crustal growth also progressed in the Paleoproterozoic through accretionary orogenesis. This accretion occurred within the Wopmay orogen through ca. 1.88 Ga arc-continent collision that led to the accretion of the Hottah terrane (the Calderian orogeny) and the subsequent emplacement of the Great Bear magmatic zone from ca. 1.88 to 1.84 Ga \citep{Hildebrand2009a}. Coeval with the Trans-Hudson orogeny was the perphiral Penokean orogeny during which both microcontinent blocks (the Marshfield terrane) and arc terranes accreted on the southeastern margin of the west Superior province ca. 1.86 to 1.82 \citep{Schulz2007a}. Firm evidence of the end of the orogeny comes from the ca. 1.78 undeformed plutons of the post-Penokean East Central Minnesota Batholith \citep{Holm2005a}. 

In the paleogeographic model framework of \cite{Pehrsson2015a}, the collisions of provinces and terranes leading up to the Trans-Hudson orogeny mark the initial phase of assembly of the supercontinent Nuna. The Trans-Hudson orogeny itself is taken to be the terminal collision associated with the closure of the Manikewan Ocean that had previous been a large oceanic tract separating the Superior province from the composite Slave+Rae+Hearne+North Atlantic provinces (often referred to as the Churchill domain or plate; e.g. \citealp{Skipton2016a, Weller2017a}). The \cite{Pehrsson2015a} model posits that this period terminal collision not only resulted in the amalgamation of Laurentia, but is also associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Nuna that is hypothesized to include other major Paleoproterozoic cratons including Siberia, Congo/S\~ao Francisco, West Africa, and Amazonia \citep{Whitmeyer2007a, Pehrsson2015a}. 

Following the Trans-Hudson orogeny, the locus of orogenesis migrated to the exterior of Laurentia. This change marks a shift in the predominant style of Laurentia's growth as subsequent crustal growth occurred dominantly through accretion of juvenile crust along the southern and eastern margin of the nucleus of Archean provinces (\citealp{Whitmeyer2007a}; Figs. \ref{fig:Laurentia_map} and \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). Determining the extent of these belts is complicated by poor exposure of them in the midcontinent relative to the exposure of the Archean provinces throughout the Canadian shield. Major growth of Laurentia following the amalgamation of these Archean provinces occurred associated with the arc-continent collision of the ca. 1.71 to 1.68 Ga Yavapai orogeny. Yavapai orogenesis is interpreted to have resulted from the accretion of a series of arc terranes that collided with each other and Laurentia \citep{Karlstrom2001a}. Yavapai accretion was followed by widespread emplacement of granitoid intrusions \citep{Whitmeyer2007a}. These intrusions are hypothesized to have stabilized the juvenile accreted terranes that subsequently remained part of Laurentia \citep{Whitmeyer2007a}. Subsequent accretionary orogenesis of the ca. 1.65–1.60 Ga Mazatzal Orogeny and associated plutonism lead to further crustal growth in the latest Paleoproterozoic \citep{Karlstrom1988a}. Laurentia's growth continued in the Mesoproterozoic along the southeast margin through further juvenile terrane and arc accretion. An interval of major plutonism occurred ca. 1.48–1.35 Ga leading to the formation of A-type granitoids throughout both Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic provinces extending from the southwest United States up to the Central Gneiss Belt of Ontario to the northeast of Georgian Bay \citep{Slagstad2009a}. This plutonism is likely due to crustal melting within a back-arc region of ca. 1.50 to 1.43 Ga accretionary orogenesis \citep{Bickford2015a}. Younger magmatic activity ca. 1.37 Ga  of the Southern Granite–Rhyolite Province suggests a similar tectonic setting of accretionary orogenesis at that time \citep{Bickford2015a}. While an active margin interpretation with magmatism in back‐arc setting has gained traction within the literature with additional data, the tectonic setting is often described as enigmatic given earlier interpretations of an anorogenic setting (see references in \citealp{Slagstad2009a}).

\end{figure}

Accretionary orogenesis continued along the (south)east margin of Laurentia with the arc-continent collision of the ca. 1.25-1.22 Ga Elzevirian orogeny \citep{McLelland2013a}. The subsequent ca. 1.19 to 1.16 Ga Shawinigan orogeny is interpreted to be due to the accretion of a terrane comprised of amalgamated arc volcanics and associated metasediments and is followed by a period of tectonic quiescence on the eastern margin of Laurentia until the collision orogenesis of the Grenvillian orogeny \citep{McLelland2010a}. In the latest Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1.11-1.08 Ga), a major intracontinental rift co-located with a large igneous province formed in Laurentia's interior leading to extension within the Archean Superior province and Paleoproterozoic provinces. This Midcontinent Rift lead to the formation of a thick succession of volcanics and mafic intrusions that are well-preserved in Laurentia's interior.  Midcontinent Rift development ceased as major collisional orogenesis of the Grenvillian orogeny began \citep{Swanson-Hysell2019a}. The Grenvillian orogeny was a protracted interval of continent-continent collision (ca. 1.09 to 0.98 Ga) leading to amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphism through the orogen \citep{McLelland2010a}. The orogeny is interpreted to have resulted in the development of a thick orogenic plateau \citep{Rivers2008a}.

There is significantly less preserved crustal growth on the western margin of Laurentia (Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_map}) and the Mesoproterozoic tectonic history is not as well elucidated as on the southern to eastern margin. The 15 to 20 km thick package of sedimentary rocks of the Belt-Purcell Supergroup is associated with a ca. 1.47 to 1.40 intracontinental rift -- the tectonic setting of which is debated. \citet{Hoffman1989a} proposed that it may be a remanent back-arc basin trapped within a continent, while others envision it as being associated with continental rifting along the margin associated with separation of a conjugate continent \citep{Jones2015a}. This region is interpreted to have been subsequently deformed during a ca. 1.36 to 1.33 event known as the East Kootenay orogeny \citep{McMechan1982a, Nesheim2012a, McFarlane2015a}. 

This late Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic tectonic history provides significant constraints on paleogeographic reconstructions. In particular, the long-lived history of accretionary orogenesis along the southeast (present-day coordinates) of Laurentia from the initiation of the Yavapai orogeny (ca. 1.71 Ga) to the end of the Shawinigan orogeny (ca. 1.06 Ga) requires a long-lived open margin without a major conjugate continent until the time of terminal Grenvillian orogeny collision \citep{Karlstrom2001a}. This constraint is incorporated into models such as that of \citet{Zhang2012a} and \citet{Pehrsson2015a} which maintain a long-lived convergent margin throughout the Mesoproterozoic, but in some reconstructions other continental blocks are reconstructed into positions that are seemingly incompatible with this record of accretionary orogenesis (e.g. Amazonia in \citealp{Elming2009a}). The high-grade metamorphism associated with the Ottawan phase of the Grenvillian orogeny itself requires a collision between Laurentia and (an)other continent(s) ca. 1080 Ma -- the geological observation of which first lead to the formulation of the hypothesis of the supercontinent Rodinia \citep{Hoffman1991a}. Evidence of large-scale continent-continent collision at the time of the Ottawan Phase of the Grenvillian orogeny is recorded in Texas, up through the Blue Ridge Appalachian inliers, through Ontario and up to the Labrador Sea. This extensive and major collision orogenic history recorded in Laurentia remains a strong piece of evidence that a supercontinent or (proto)supercontinent formed at the 1.0 Ga Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic transition. The term Grenville orogeny or Grenville belt is used rather loosely throughout much of the literature to refer to any late Mesoproterozoic orogenic belt. The timeline of orogenesis on the Laurentia margin has more nuanced constraints that this usage and these constraints can be comparatively assessed when evaluating potential conjugate continents to Laurentia associated with the orogen (Fig. \ref{fig:tectonic_history}).

The subsequent Neoproterozoic tectonic history of Laurentia is dominantly a record of rifting (Fig. \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). Along the western margin of Laurentia, small-scale rifting occurred ca. 780 to 720 Ma leading to deposition in basins that is recorded from the Death Valley region of SW Laurentia up to the Mackenzie Mountains of NW Laurentia \citep{Macdonald2012a, Rooney2017a}. However, this extensional basin development is relatively minor and predates the more significant rifting that lead to passive margin thermal subsidence that did not occur until the Ediacaran Period (closer to the ca. 539 Ma Neoproterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary; \citealp{Bond1984a, Levy1991a}). The emplacement of the ca. 780 Ma Gunbarrel large igneous province along this margin and the subsequent extension recorded in the basins is commonly interpreted to be associated with the break-up of Laurentia and a conjugate continent to the western margin. If this interpretation is correct, it is unclear why there would be minimal thermal subsidence until the Ediacaran (post 635 Ma as in \citealp{Levy1991a} and \citealp{Witkosky2018a}). The geological evidence therefore supports active tectonism along the western margin of Laurentia, but suggests that more dramatic lithospheric thinning occurred later than the timing of rifting typically implemented in models of Rodinia break-up. One possibility, along the lines of that proposed in \citet{Ross1991a}, is that ca. 780 Ma extensional tectonism is an inboard record of rifting and passive margin development that occurred further outboard. In this model, subsequent continent rifting that drove lithospheric thinning, perhaps associated with the departure of a microcontinent fragment rather than an already departed major conjugate continent, would be the cause of Ediacaran to Cambrian thermal subsidence. The margin that did experience large-scale rifting and associated passive margin thermal subsidence earlier in the Neoproterozoic is the northeast Greenland margin (Fig. \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). Available geochronological constraints and thermal subsidence modeling indicate ca. 820 Ma rifting followed by thermal subsidence of a stable platform \citep{Maloof2006a, Halverson2018a}. These data suggest that conjugate continental lithosphere rifted away from northeast Greenland ca. 820 Ma. 

Extensive rifting that was followed by thermal subsidence occurred along the southeast to east Laurentia margin leading up to the Neoproterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary and is interpreted to be associated with the opening of the Iapetus ocean. A record of this rifting is preserved as rift basins that were part of failed arms (Rome trough, Reelfoot rift and Oklahoma aulacogen; Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_map}) as well as prolonged Cambrian to Ordovician passive margin thermal subsidence along the margin \citep{Bond1984a, Whitmeyer2007a}. The age of igneous intrusions that have been interpreted to be rift-related play a significant role in interpretations of this history such as in the rift development model of \citet{Burton2010a}. In this model, spatially-restricted rifting occurs ca. 760 to 680 Ma in the region of modern-day North Carolina and Virginia. Rifting ca. 620 to 580 Ma initiates in the region from modern-day New York to Newfoundland and by ca. 580 to 550 Ma rifting extends along the length of Laurentia's eastern margin. The last phases of this rifting appears to be associated with the separation of the Argentine pre-Cordillera Cuyania terrane \citep{Dickerson1998a}. Cuyania is widely interpreted be a rifted fragment of SE Laurentia that separated associated with this early Cambrian rifting and subsequently became part of Gondwana when it collided with other terranes in the vicinity of the Rio de Plata craton during the Ordovician Famatinian orogeny \citep{Martin2019a}. As with other rifts, it is difficult to distinguish the separation of a cratonic fragment as a microcontinent from the rifting of a major craton as the record that lingers on the craton is similar. One interpretation is that there was successful break-up along the eastern margin during the ca. 580 to 550 Ma interval of rifting prior to the ca. 539 Oklahoma aulacogen rifting that liberated the Cuyania microcontinent. The Maz–Arequipa–Rio Apa (MARA) block with which Cuyania collided \citep{Martin2019a} is likely a product of such rifting. Orogenesis between the MARA block and the Rio de Plata and Kalahari in the ca. 530 Ma Pampean orogeny \citep{Casquet2018a} predated the collision of Cuyania during the ca. 460 Ma Famatinian orogeny in West Gondwana \citep{Rapalini2018a}. 

The eastern margin of Laurentia then went through the cycle of Appalachian orogenesis. As is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:tectonic_history}, there are parallels between the Grenville orogenic interval and the Appalachian orogenic interval in that there was a period of arc-continent collision (Shawinigan orogeny in the Grenville interval; Taconic orogeny in the Appalachian interval) followed by microcontinent accretion (Llano in the Grenville interval; Acadian in the Appalachian interval) that culminated in large-scale continent-continent collision (Grenvillian orogeny in the Grenville interval; Alleghanian in the Appalachian interval). These similarities are the consequence of an active margin facing an ocean basin that was progressively consumed until its consumption resulted in continent-continent collision. In the case of the Grenville interval, this terminal collision is interpreted to be associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia and in the Appalachian interval it is interpreted to be associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea.

Even without considering other continents on Earth, the geological record of Paleoproterozoic collisional of Archean provinces combined with accretionary orogenesis at that time and through the rest of the Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic Eras provides very strong evidence for mobile plate tectonics driving Laurentia's evolution throughout the past 2 billion years. This tectonic history inferred from geological data can be enhanced through integration with the paleomagnetic record.

\subsection{Paleomagnetic pole compilation}

\label{fig:Laurentia_poles}
\end{figure} 

In this chapter, I focus on the compilation of paleomagnetic poles developed through the Nordic Paleomagnetism Workshops with some additions and modifications (Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_poles} and Table 2). The Nordic Paleomagnetism Workshops have taken the approach of using expert panels to assess paleomagnetic poles and assign them grades meant to convey the confidence that the community has in these results (Evans et al., this volume). While many factors associated with paleomagnetic poles can be assessed quantitatively through Fisher statistics and the precision of geochronological constraints, other aspects such as the degree to which available field tests constrain the magnetization to be primary require expert assessment. The categorizations used by the expert panel are `A' and `B' with the last panel meeting occurring in Fall 2017 in Leirubakki, Iceland. An `A' rating refers to poles that are judged to be of such high-quality that they provide essential constraints that should be satisfied in paleogeographic reconstructions. A `B' rating is associated with poles that are judged to likely provide a high-quality constraint, but have some deficiency such as remaining ambiguity in the demonstration of primary remanence or the quality/precision of available geochronologic constraints. Additional poles that were not given an `A' or `B' classification at the Nordic Workshops are referred to as not-rated (`NR'). These additional poles are taken from the Paleomagia database \citep{Veikkolainen2014a}. Many of these poles are quite valuable for reconstruction and should not be dismissed from being considered in paleogeographic reconstructions. However, there are ambiguities associated with many of such poles not given Nordic `A' or `B' ratings in terms of how well the nature of the remanence is constrained including its age. For example, there are rich data associated with intrusive and metamorphic lithologies of the Grenville Province that are the available paleomagnetic constraints for Laurentia at the Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic boundary. However, the ages of the remanence associated with these poles is complicated by the reality that the magnetization was acquired during exhumation and such cooling ages are more difficult to robustly constrain than the ages of remanence associated with dated eruptive units or shallow-level intrusions. As a result, the vast majority of Grenville Province poles are not given an `A' or `B' rating with the exception of the `B' rated pole from the ca. 1015 Ma Haliburton intrusions. However, while any one of these Grenville poles could be interpreted to suffer from large temporal uncertainty, the overall preponderance of poles in a similar location at the time suggests that they need to be taken seriously within any paleogeographic reconstruction of Laurentia (although note an alternative view of an allochthonous origin put forward by \citet{Halls2015a} is discussed below). In this compilation, the poles of \cite{Brown2012a} from the Adirondack highlands are used wherein the magnetic mineralogy and associated relative ages of remanence are well-constrained (Table 2). Additional not-rated poles included in the present compilation is the new pole for the ca. 1144 Ma Ontario lamprophyre dykes \citep{Piispa2018a} that strengthens the position of Laurentia at the time and coincides with the position of the poles from the ca. 1140 Ma Abitibi dikes \citep{Ernst1993a}. This pole will likely receive an `A' rating when assessed at the next Nordic paleomagnetism workshop. Poles from the Neoproterozoic Chuar Group as presented in \cite{Eyster2019a} are also included. 

\subsection{Differential motion before Laurentia amalgamation}

Prior to the termination of the Trans-Hudson orogeny (before 1.8 Ga), paleomagnetic poles need to be considered with respect to the individual Archean provinces. For the Superior province, an additional complexity is that paleomagnetic poles from Siderian to Rhyacian Period (2.50 to 2.05 Ga) dike swarms, as well as deflection of dike trends, support an interpretation that there was substantial Paleoproterozoic rotation of the western Superior province relative to the eastern Superior province across the Kapuskasing Structural Zone \citep{Bates1991a, Evans2010a}. This interpretation is consistent with the hypothesis of \citet{Hoffman1988a} that the Kapuskasing Structural Zone represents major intracratonic uplift related to the Trans-Hudson orogeny. \cite{Evans2010a} propose an Euler rotation of (51\textdegree N, 85\textdegree W, -14\textdegree CCW) to reconstruct western Superior relative to eastern Superior and interpret that the rotation occurred in the time interval of 2.07 to 1.87 Ga.  I follow this interpretation and group the poles into Superior (West) and Superior (East).  Uncertainty remains with respect to whether the ca. 1.88 Ga Molson dikes pole pre-dates or post-dates this rotation \citep{Evans2010a} and thus for the time being should be considered solely in the western Superior province reference frame.

\label{fig:Superior_Slave_recons}
\end{figure} 

There are poles in the compilation for the Slave, Wyoming, Rae, Superior and North Atlantic provinces prior to Laurentia amalgamation (Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_poles} and Table 2). Overall, these data provide an opportunity to re-evaluate the paleomagnetic evidence for relative motions between Archean provinces prior to Laurentia assembly. A lingering question raised in \citet{Hoffman1988a} that still remains is to what extent the Archean provinces each had independent drift histories with significant separation or shared histories before experiencing fragmentation and reamalgamation. The strongest analysis in this regard comes from comparisons between paleomagnetic poles between the Superior and Slave provinces \citep{Buchan2009a, Mitchell2014a, Buchan2016a}. High-quality paleomagnetic poles from these two provinces provide strong support for differential motion between the Superior and Slave provinces between 2.2 and 1.8 Ga with the two provinces not being in their modern-day relative orientation to one another either and having distinct pole paths as constrained by 5 time periods of nearly coeval poles from 2.23 and 1.89 Ga (Fig. \ref{fig:Superior_Slave_recons}; \citealp{Buchan2016a}. These data provide paleomagnetic support for the Superior and Slave provinces having independent histories of differential motion. They also support the hypothesis that the Trans-Hudson orogeny is the result of terminal collision associated with the closure of an ocean basin between the Superior province and the Hearne+Rae+Slave provinces. Reconstructions developed for this chapter of the Superior and Slave provinces using these poles are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Superior_Slave_recons} and illustrate the difference in implied orientation and paleolatitude that results from these well-constrained poles.

\subsection{Paleogeography of an assembled Laurentia}

Following the amalgamation of the Archean provinces in Laurentia ca. 1.8 Ga, poles from each part of Laurentia can be considered to reflect the position of the entire composite craton. It is worth considering the possibility that poles from zones of Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic accretion could be allochthonous to the craton. \cite{Halls2015b} argued that this was the case for late Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic poles from east of the Grenvillian allochthon boundary fault. However, the majority of researchers have considered these poles to post-date major differential motion and be associated with cooling during collapse of a thick orogenic plateau developed during continent-continent collision (e.g. \citealp{Brown2012a}). Poles with a B-rating are also included in the composite that come from Greenland, Svalbard and Scotland. These terranes were once part of contiguous Laurentia, but have subsequently rifted away. These poles need to be rotated into the Laurentia reference frame prior to use for tectonic reconstruction and I apply the rotations shown in Table \ref{tab:terrane_rotations}. The Euler pole and rotation is quite well-constrained for Greenland as it is associated with recent opening of Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea (for which the rotation of \citealp{Roest1989a} is used). The reconstruction of Scotland is associated with the opening of the Atlantic (for which the rotation employed by \citealp{Torsvik2017a} is used) which is well-constrained but has more uncertainty associated with the Euler pole than that for Greenland. The reconstruction of Svalbard is more challenging given a multi-state tectonic history involving both translation within the Caledonides and subsequent rifting. The preferred Euler of \cite{Maloof2006a} is used here. This Euler is designed, in particular, to honor the high degree of similarity between Tonian sediments in East Greenland \citep{Hoffman2012a} and those of East Svalbard \citep{Maloof2006a} and to reconstruct East Svalbard to be aligned with these correlative sedimentary rocks.

Through the Proterozoic, there are intervals where there are abundant paleomagnetic poles that constrain Laurentia's position and intervals when the record is quite sparse (shown colored by age in Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_poles}). To further visualize the temporal coverage of the poles and to summarize the motion, implied paleolatitudes for an interior point on Laurentia are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude}. The ages of the utilized paleomagnetic poles are also shown in comparison to the simplified summary of tectonic events in Figure \ref{fig:tectonic_history}. Both collisional and extensional tectonism can result in the formation of lithologies that can be used to develop paleomagnetic poles either as a result of basin formation, magmatism or both. In addition, intraplate magmatism resulting from plume-related large-igneous provinces can lead to paleomagnetic poles in periods that are otherwise characterized by tectonic quiescence (e.g. the ca. 1267 Ma Mackenzie LIP; Fig. \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). Intracontinental rifts have led to the highest density of poles both in the case of the ca. 1.4 Ga Belt Supergroup and the ca. 1.1 Ga Midcontinent Rift (Fig. \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). The quality and resolution of the record from the Midcontinent Rift is aided by the voluminous magmatism that occurred in conjunction with basin formation that enables the development of well-calibrated apparent polar wander path \citep{Swanson-Hysell2019a}. The late Tonian Period also has a number of poles including the Gunbarrel LIP (ca. 780 Ma) and Franklin LIP (ca. 720 Ma), as well as similiarly-aged sedimentary rocks from western Laurentia basins \citep{Eyster2019a}. Overall, there is internal consistency among the paleomagnetic poles within intervals for which there is high-resolution coverage. These data result in progressive paths such as ascending up to the Logan Loop, down the Keweenawan Track \citep{Swanson-Hysell2019a} to the Grenville Loop prior to a temporal gap before the late Tonian (ca. 775 to 720 Ma) path \citep{Eyster2019a}. 

Data from other terranes add resolution to the record. In particular, data from Greenland adds 12 poles between 1385 and 1160 Ma when there are only 4 poles from mainland Laurentia. Given that the rotation between Greenland and mainland Laurentia is well-constrained (Table \ref{tab:terrane_rotations}), once rotated these poles can be used for reconstruction of the entire continent. The reliability of this approach gains credence through the good agreement between the ca. 1633 Ma Melville Bugt diabase dykes pole from Greenland \citep{Halls2011a} and the ca. 1590 Ma Western Channel diabase pole of mainland Laurentia \citep{Irving1972a}. Similarly, there is good agreement between the ca. 1267 Ma Mackenzie dykes pole of Laurentia \citep{Buchan2000a} and coeval poles from Greenland such as the ca. 1275 Ma North Qoroq intrusives \citep{Piper1992a} and Kungnat Ring dyke \citep{Piper1977a}. Furthermore, the Greenland poles with ages that fall between the ca. 1237 Ma Sudbury dikes and ca. 1143 Ma lamprophyre dykes pole of mainland Laurentia are consistent with constraints on either side from the mainland while filling in the ascending limb of the path leading up to the apex of 1140 to 1108 Ma poles known as the Logan Loop (Fig. \ref{fig:Logan_Loop}).

An exception to this overall agreement between poles from Greenland and mainland Laurentia occurs ca. 1382 Ma. There are poles of this age from Greenland associated with the Zig-Zag Dal basalts and related intrusions \citep{Marcussen1983a, Abrahamsen1987a}. However, these poles are in a distinct location from poles of similar age associated with the Belt Supergroup (e.g. the McNamara Formation and Pilcher/Garnet Range and Libby Formations; \citealp{Elston2002a}). Additionally, the older Belt Supergroup poles form a more southerly population than time-equivalent poles from elsewhere in Laurentia such as the Mistastin Pluton. There are potential complications associated with the Belt Supergroup being exposed within thrust sheets with significant Cenozoic Mesozoic and Cenozoic deformation. However, vertical axis rotations of the Belt region are not able to bring the Belt poles into agreement with those from Laurentia or Greenland nor is translation away from the craton. Another potential complication is that the remanence used for the development of the Belt Supergroup resides in hematite. As a result, there is the potential for inclination-flatting within the sedimentary rocks from which poles are developed. However, applying a moderate inclination factor of $f=0.6$ also does not bring the poles into congruence with the Zig-Zag basalts.  There is the potential that the hematite could be the result of post-depositional oxidation (the remanence of the Purcell lavas pole is also held by hematite) however the overall coherency of the pole directions and the presence of reversals has been taken as evidence that the remanence is primary \citep{Elston2002a}. At present, it is unclear which poles are a better representation of Laurentia's position ca. 1400 Ma.

Another challenging portion of the Laurentia record is that for the Ediacaran Period where there is little consistency between poles of similar age (Figs. \ref{fig:Laurentia_poles} and \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitudes}). As a result, there are poles that imply both low-latitude and high-latitude positions of Laurentia between 615 and 565 Ma. One explanation for these variable pole positions is that they are the result of large-scale oscillatory true polar wander in the Ediacaran that has influenced poles in Baltica and West Africa as well \citep{McCausland2007a, Robert2017a}. Another possibility is that the lack of congruency between poles in this point in the record is due to a particularly weak and non-dipolar geomagnetic field \citep{Abrajevitch2010a, Bono2019a}. Regardless of mechanism, the Ediacaran data stand out as anomalous relative to the coherency of the rest of the poles in the composite (Fig. \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude}).

%A nice touch would be to add Paleoproterozoic, Meso, Neo and Phanero onto this figure

Synthesizing the compilation of paleomagnetic poles for Laurentia into a composite path over the past 1.8 billion years presents a challenge given the highly variable temporal coverage. The method typically applied in the Phanerozoic is to develop synthesized pole paths either through fitting spherical splines through the data or calculating binned running means where the Fisher mean of poles within a given interval are calculated \citep{Torsvik2012a}. Applying such an approach can reduce the effect of spurious poles in regions of high data density where seeking to satisfy every mean pole position would result in jerky motion. 

A synthesized pole path for Laurentia is developed here and used to develop a continuous paleogeographic reconstruction of Laurentia constrained by the compilation of paleomagnetic poles. The paleolatitude implied by this continuous model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude}. This path is based on Laurentia data alone which means that it is poorly constrained through intervals of sparse data (950-850 Ma for example). One could use interpretations of paleogeographic connections with other cratons (e.g. Baltica in the early Neoproterozoic) to fill in such portions of the path, however the result then becomes model-dependent without being constrained by data from Laurentia itself. In portions of the record with a more dense record of poles, such as ca. 1450, a calculated running mean is used to integrate constraints from multiple poles. This method follows the approach taken in the Phanerozoic (e.g. \citealp{Torsvik2012a} wherein all poles within a 20 Myr interval are averaged with the interval than progressively moved forward in 10 Myr steps. When there are isolated `A' grade poles without other temporally-similar poles, these poles are fully satisfied in model. Where there are no constraints a simple interpolation between constraints is made. While data from Scotland and Svalbard are associated with Laurentia, the Scotland poles are poorly constrained in time and the Svalbard rotation to Laurentia is uncertain. These poles are not utilized in the simple Laurentia model which means that the model as shown does not include oscillatory true polar wander interpreted to have occurred ca. 810 and 790 Ma based on data from Svalbard \citep{Maloof2006a}. 

One downside of a running mean approach is that it pulls the mean to regions of high data density. As was shown in \cite{Swanson-Hysell2019a}, this behavior can reduce motion along an apparent polar wander path. As a result, for the portion of the reconstruction during the interval of time ca. 1110 to 1070 Ma, I utilize an Euler pole inversion from \cite{Swanson-Hysell2019a}.

Paleogeographic snapshots for the past position of Laurentia reconstructed using this synthesis of the paleomagnetic poles are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_reconstructions}. These reconstructions use the tectonic elements as defined by \citet{Whitmeyer2007a} with these elements being progressively added associated with Laurentia's accretionary growth. As a reminder to the reader, paleomagnetic poles provide constraints on the paleolatitude of a continental block as well as its orientation (which way was north relative to the block). While they provide constraints in this regard, they do not provide constraints in and of themselves of the longitudinal position of the block. Other approaches to obtain paleolongitude utilize geophysical hypotheses such as assuming that large low shear velocity provinces have been stable plume-generating zones in the lower mantle to which plumes can be reconstructed \citep{Torsvik2014a} or that significant pole motion in certain time intervals is associated with true polar wander axes that switch through time in conjunction with the supercontinent cycle \citep{Mitchell2012a}. In Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_reconstructions}, Laurentia is centered on the longitudinal position of Duluth with the orientation and paleolatitude being constrained by the paleomagnetic pole compilation as synthesized in the simple Laurentia pole interpolation model. The continuous paleolatitude implied by this model is shown as the simple Laurentia pole interpolation mode in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude}.

\subsection{Comparing paleogeographic models to the paleomagnetic compilation}

Developing comprehensive global continuous paleogeographic models is a major challenge given the need to integrate and satisfy diverse geological and paleomagnetic data types. Continually improving constraints related to tectonic setting from improved geologic and geochronologic data need to be carefully integrated with the database of paleomagnetic poles. Paleomagnetic poles compilations themselves are evolving with better data and improved geochronology. Efforts such as this volume are therefore essential to present the state-of-the-art in terms of existing constraints that can be used to evaluate current models and set the stage for future progress in Precambrian paleogeography.

Modern coastlines are maintained in these polygons so that the rotated orientations can be interpreted by the reader in comparison to Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_map}. Paleomagnetic poles within 25 million years of each reconstruction time are plotted.

\label{fig:Laurentia_reconstructions}
\end{figure} 

There is an overall lack of models in the literature for the Proterozoic have published continuous rotation parameters that can be compared to the compilation of paleomagnetic poles presented herein. The approach in the community for many years has been to publish models as snapshots at given time intervals presented in figures without publishing continuous rotation parameters although some studies have published the Euler rotations associated with specified times. With the further adoption of software tools such as GPlates, there has been significant progress in the publication of continuous paleogeographic models constrained by paleomagnetic poles through the Phanerozoic (540 Ma to present; e.g. \citealp{Torsvik2012a}).
 
An exception to the paucity of published continuous paleogeographic models for the Precambrian is the Neoproterozoic model of \cite{Merdith2017b} which is shown in comparison to the constraints for Laurentia in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude}. The extent to which the implied position of Laurentia in \cite{Merdith2017b} is consistent with the compiled paleomagnetic constraints can be visualized in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude}. As noted above, the development of such models is challenging and the researchers need to balance varying constraints. The focus here will be on the extent to which this model satisfies the available paleomagnetic poles for Laurentia. The model does not honor the Grenville loop (e.g. go to moderately high southerly latitudes ca. 1000 Ma) which is a striking departure from the paleomagnetic record and standard paleogeographic models. Additionally, the implemented plate motion strays from the younger poles of the Keweenawan Track and does not honor the Franklin LIP pole \cite{Denyszyn2009b} despite its `A' Nordic rating. The Franklin pole is taken to be a key constraint at the Tonian/Cryogenian boundary that provides evidence of the supercontinent Rodinia being equatorial and for the Sturtian glaciation having extended to equatorial latitudes \citep{Macdonald2010a}.

There are more published models that show snapshots and publish rotation parameters associated with given time intervals such as the Rodinia model of \cite{Li2008a} and the Mesoproterozoic model of \cite{Pisarevsky2014b}, but did not publish parameters for a continuous model. The position for Laurentia implied by the Euler poles given for the model snapshots of these studies are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude} and can be compared to the compiled record. 

\subsection{Conclusion}

There is strong evidence both in Laurentia's geological and paleomagnetic record for differential plate tectonic motion between 2.2 and 1.8 Ga. The continued history of accretionary orogenesis and the evaluation of Laurentia's pole path in comparison to other continents from 1.8 Ga onward supports the continual operation of plate tectonics throughout the rest of the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic as well. While this evidence fits with the majority of interpretations of the timing of initiation of modern-style plate tectonics (see summary in \citealp{Korenaga2013a}), there continue to be arguments proposing that a stagnant lid persisted through the Mesoproterozoic Era (1.6 to 1.0 Ga) and into the Neoproterozoic  with plate tectonics not initiating until ca. 0.8 Ga \citep{Hamilton2011a, Stern2018a}. These arguments rest largely on the relative lack of Proterozoic low-temperature high-pressure metamorphic rocks such as blueschists that form in subduction zones \citep{Stern2013a}. An alternative interpretation for this lack of blueschists in the Proterozoic is that such a shift in metamorphic regime is the predicted result of secular evolution of mantle chemistry rather than a harbinger of the onset of plate tectonics \citep{Palin2015a}. While this line of evidence is intriguing, to argue that there was not differential plate tectonic motion in the Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic is to ignore a vast breadth and depth of geological and paleomagnetic data. From a paleomagnetic perspective, there is strong support for independent and differential motion of the Slave and Superior provinces as is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Superior_Slave_recons}. From a geological perspective, the Trans-Hudson orogenic cycle, the Grenville orogenic cycle, and the Appalachian orogenic cycle are all well-explained with a mobilistic interpretation that includes phases of accretionary followed by collisional orogenesis (Fig. \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). One could counter that this perspective results from a plate-tectonic-centric viewpoint that lacks creativity to see the record as resulting from other processes than modern-style plate tectonics. However, in addition to the broad geological record showing an amalgamation of terranes as would be expected to arise through plate tectonics, there are also ecologites preserved in the Trans-Hudson orogen that preserve evidence for high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic conditions ca. 1.8 Ga \citep{Weller2017a}. Similar to the Himalayan orogen, these rocks are interpreted to be the result of deep continental subduction and exhumation associated with convergent plate tectonics \citep{Weller2017a}. Outside of Laurentia, there are examples of ecologites with geochemical affinity to oceanic crust such as that documented in the ca. 1.9 Ga Ubendian Belt of the Congo craton \citep{Boniface2012a}.

\label{fig:Grenville_reconstructions}
\end{figure}

Another perspective on Proterozoic tectonics, is that the record is one of intermittent subduction \citep{Silver2008a, ONeill2013a}. In such a model, there are extended intervals with a stagnant lid alternating with intervals of differential plate motion. In particular, it was been argued that the Mesoproterozoic Era (1.6 to 1.0 Ga) is an interval when Earth was in a stagnant regime \citep{Silver2008a, ONeill2013a}. The accretionary history of Laurentia following the amalgamation of the Archean provinces is difficult to reconcile with such an interpretation (Figs. \ref{fig:Laurentia_map} and \ref{fig:tectonic_history}). An additional constraint comes from the presence of reliable paleomagnetic poles themselves that are complete with baked contact tests. In a stagnant lid regime, there would not be sufficient heat flow to sustain a geodynamo and Earth should not have had a geomagnetic field that would have enable the preservation of paleomagnetic poles with positive field tests. The record of these poles also show that there was motion of Laurentia (Figs. \ref{fig:Laurentia_paleolatitude} and \ref{fig:Laurentia_reconstructions}). Using data from Laurentia alone, however, it is difficult to ascertain whether this motion is due to plate tectonic motion or rotation of the entire solid Earth through true polar wander. True polar wander can lead to changing position relative to the spin axis even with a stagnant lid. One interval when the Laurentian paleomagnetic record demands that some of the motion is through differential plate tectonics is in the latest Mesoproterozoic. At that time, the pole path is very well-resolved with many high-quality paleomagnetic poles between 1110 and 1070 Ma (Table 2; \ref{fig:Laurentia_poles}). The progression of the poles requires rotation about an Euler pole that is distinct from a great circle path which would result if the motion were solely due to true polar wander \citep{Swanson-Hysell2019a}. These poles constrain rapid motion of Laurentia leading up to collisional orogenesis associated with the Grenvillian orogeny as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Grenville_reconstructions}. These data provide strong evidence for differential plate motion at the time and are inconsistent with a stagnant lid. Rather the orogenic cycle of the Mesoproterozoic bears similarity with that of the Paleozoic and reveals Laurentia to have been a central player in the building of amalgamated continents associated with Rodinia and Pangea. 

The paleogeographic record of Laurentia is rich in constraints through the Precambrian both in terms of the geological and geochronological constraints on tectonism and the record of paleomagnetic poles. As can be seen in the Chapters on Archean paleogeography (Salminen et al., this volume), Nuna (Elming et al., this volume) and Rodinia (Evans et al., this volume), these constraints are at the center of developing paleogeographic models through the Precambrian and will continue to be moving forward.
